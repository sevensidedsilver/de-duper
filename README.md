This repository features an app built as a coding challenge for a potential employer.

The app takes in a group of objects pulled from JSON data and removes duplicate records (duplicate emails and ids).

It follows the rule to prefer the data with the most recent date and also reports which records were changed.

## Run Instructions:

The app uses npm to boot.

Clone this repository, change directory into it, then use the commands

"npm i" - to install dependencies, then

"npm start" - to launch the app

### Closing Notes:

Its not pretty but it fufills the functional requirements... might update the styles a bit over the weekend if I have time.
